Model has vertically stretched grids. So, it requires interpolation to plot PPI
or RHI of synthetic polarimetric variables. This may introduce additionaly uncertainty
in diagnosing the polarimetric singatures. So, to avoid any interpolation of polarimetric moments, it would be desirable to plot the variables in their native co-ordinates.

ppi_model.ncl   -> Shows the variability in spatial pattern dz and height at different
                   half-levels.
rhi_model.ncl   -> Shows the variability in dz and height at different half-levels when
                   plotting c-s.

compare_ppi_model.ncl --> Compares synthetic polarimetric variables between model level data and interpolated data for average
                          model mass point height in that model level (a.m.s.l)
compare_rhi_model.ncl --> Compares synthetic polarimetric variables between model level data and interpolated data
