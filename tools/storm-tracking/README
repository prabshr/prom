Storm Mask Tutorial

1) Run the storm tracking algorithm

cd prom/tools/storm-tracking

<Edit pid and expname> in track_emv_zh.ncl
ncl track_emv_zh.ncl inst=8
<It will generate a netCDF file, explore the file to identify
 the storm at initial stage and location (inside storm)>
 t, y, x

<Edit pid and expname> in edgeDetetction.ncl
ncl edgeDetetction.ncl step=0 inst=8
<It will generate a netcdf file containing edges of storm>

<Edit pid and expname> in dxy.ncl
<Also upade t, y, x>
ncl dxy.ncl inst=8
<It will generate a text file with storm location>

ncl edgeDetetction.ncl step=1 inst=8
<It will generate a storm mask smask*.nc>
<View the netcdf file, and check if mask is missing in some time snapshots,
play with iy and ix and re-run the script>

2) Data Archive

Move the smask*.nc and cell*.txt to /nc and /txt located in
/daten/daten04/pshrestha/shared-data/storm_mask

3) Remove remaining netcdf files
rm PROM*.nc
rm data_0.nc
